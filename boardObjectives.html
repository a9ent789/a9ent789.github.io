                The SIP prototype was made through many different semesters using multiple design processes. One of which is the SIP brief which begins the creation of the product by creating a document that explains what is necessary for completion. Along with that it has the design for the prototype and button mapping for app directions.

                    This website is designated to learn the process of using AI to create something. It was difficult at first, because the AI couldn't understand what I wanted or wouldn't make something that worked. The problem was how can I use AI to develop something, and this shows me solving that problem and creating something with it.

                    This one is different because this is something I have been working on in my own time. I thought it would be cool to have a website that holds my resume instead of just having a paper resume. I wanted an easier way to send my resume to future employers and took a lot of time actually creating something. Even though it isn't finished it is something I plan to continuously work on for a long time to come.

                    This program is 2 of the three that uses software development in a language that I don't really know that well. This is programmed in react native and it is built for phone apps. We used another program to be able to test the app on our phone. It was just a react testing application. Since I mainly program in C++ this was far out of my scope.

                    This is an AI chatbot that I created that uses python. Being different than react native, and also not my main language of c++ this counts well in showing that I used was able to use more than one programming language. I enjoyed learning about AI while making this, although there were some struggles figuring out exactly how to break through all of the kinks.

                    This is a game I made for the intro to game development class. And you might thing that there wasn't much programming, there was. Unfortunately it isn't anything I can put onto GitHub since the files are too large for me to upload with my internet. Although the programming used was block programming, probably one of the most used types of programming when it comes to front facing development.

                    I used this previously for demonstrating python programming. But this works great to show that data is generated. Considering that it is an AI that creates its own stories and takes in and deciphers information from the user, makes it perfect for implimenting data driven solutions. The text generated is something that I can't even predict, it generates the stories and information based on the AI model and the text that I provide.

                    This is where I started working on things to prepare for the SIP project. This program can detect what is in the picture of a picture I imput. It generates a response based on what the AI model believes that is in the picture. I can't upload the entire project, but I can upload the code. It takes the information to generate a response perfect for a data driven solution.

                    This program is one of the programs I made for the class that tought me about data structures. It shows different types of sorting, and how data put in and taken out can effect the sorting process. It generates an ordered list based on the data provided in the numbers. While for a simple program it explains well on how to sort through data effectively if you have to have a search algorithm in your future programs.
