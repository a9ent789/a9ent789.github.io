                    This program is 2 of the three that uses software development in a language that I don't really know that well. This is programmed in react native and it is built for phone apps. We used another program to be able to test the app on our phone. It was just a react testing application. Since I mainly program in C++ this was far out of my scope.

                <p>
                    This is an AI chatbot that I created that uses python. Being different than react native, and also not my main language of c++ this counts well in showing that I used was able to use more than one programming language. I enjoyed learning about AI while making this, although there were some struggles figuring out exactly how to break through all of the kinks.

                GitHub - File size too large for my internet.
                <p>
                    This is a game I made for the intro to game development class. And you might thing that there wasn't much programming, there was. Unfortunately it isn't anything I can put onto GitHub since the files are too large for me to upload with my internet. Although the programming used was block programming, probably one of the most used types of programming when it comes to front facing development.
