                    This website is designated to solve the problem of having a boards website that can be reached through the internet. My problem is that I needed a website for the inevitable boards class. This gives me a chance to show what I have done and prove that I didn't just sit around cheating on all of my programming assignments for my degree. This website is a stable to that and took a lot of design and effort.

                <p>
                    This website is designated to learn the process of using AI to create something. It was difficult at first, because the AI couldn't understand what I wanted or wouldn't make something that worked. The problem was how can I use AI to develop something, and this shows me solving that problem and creating something with it.

                <p>
                    This one is different because this is something I have been working on in my own time. I thought it would be cool to have a website that holds my resume instead of just having a paper resume. I wanted an easier way to send my resume to future employers and took a lot of time actually creating something. Even though it isn't finished it is something I plan to continuously work on for a long time to come.

                <p>
                    This program is 2 of the three that uses software development in a language that I don't really know that well. This is programmed in react native and it is built for phone apps. We used another program to be able to test the app on our phone. It was just a react testing application. Since I mainly program in C++ this was far out of my scope.

                <p>
                    This is an AI chatbot that I created that uses python. Being different than react native, and also not my main language of c++ this counts well in showing that I used was able to use more than one programming language. I enjoyed learning about AI while making this, although there were some struggles figuring out exactly how to break through all of the kinks.

                GitHub - File size too large for my internet.
                <p>
                    This is a game I made for the intro to game development class. And you might thing that there wasn't much programming, there was. Unfortunately it isn't anything I can put onto GitHub since the files are too large for me to upload with my internet. Although the programming used was block programming, probably one of the most used types of programming when it comes to front facing development.
